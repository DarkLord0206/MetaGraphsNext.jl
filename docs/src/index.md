# MetaGraphsNext.jl

Welcome to `MetaGraphsNext.jl`, an experimental, type-stable replacement for [MetaGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/MetaGraphs.jl).

## Getting started

To see how the package works, take a look at the tutorial. We first explain [the basics](tutorial_basics.md) of the `MetaGraph` structure, before moving on to its [integration](tutorial_graphs.md) with `Graphs.jl`.
